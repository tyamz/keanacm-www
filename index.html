      <h3>Objective:</h3>
      <p>The goal of this workshop is not necessarily to teach you how to create a Personal Website, though your end goal might be just that. My goal is to show you how easy it is to create a website. I want to get the "gears" going in your head so you actually go out and learn these skills for yourself.</p>
